Stuff to do:

Plan out my CLI (user looking for best wines of 2018)

Create basic structure (files/classes etc.)

Fake/force a CLI interface (hardcoded)

Build out the rough draft 

Make it real! Scrape and all that.

Discover the objects (inspecting/css selectors)

Program it out: getting the classes to interact/work
