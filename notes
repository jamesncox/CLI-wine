Stuff to do:

Plan out my CLI (user looking for best wines of 2018)

Create basic structure (files/classes etc.)

Fake/force a CLI interface (hardcoded)

Build out the rough draft 

Make it real! Scrape and all that.

Discover the objects (inspecting/css selectors)

Program it out: getting the classes to interact/work



Creating a CLI gem to give a user 95+ point wines under $20:

shows a list of wines
(name, price, rating, url for more info)

1. Domaines Schlumberger Les Princes Abbes Riesling 2014, 95 points, $19.99
2. Fabre Montmayou Reserva Cabernet Franc 2016, 96 points, $15.99
3. Susana Balbo Signature Malbec 2016, 95 points, $19.99

give a drop down, link to more info, how to purchase


make an object, build into a collection to call from

wines will have a name
wines will have a price
wines will have a rating
wines will have a single url that links to more info/how to purchase
